# Albert Einstein Website Project

This repository contains the source code for my Albert Einstein website project, developed as part of COMP 266 at Athabasca University. The project showcases my skills in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript by creating an educational website dedicated to the life and achievements of Albert Einstein. The website includes various dynamic features and interactive elements to engage users, such as:

- **Wikipedia Search**: Allows users to search Wikipedia for topics related to Albert Einstein.
- **Google Books Search**: Fetches and displays books related to Albert Einstein using the Google Books API.
- **NASA APOD**: Displays NASA's Astronomy Picture of the Day as a personal touch from the author.
- **Time Dilation Calculator**: A calculator based on Einstein's theory of relativity, built using JavaScript.
- **Slideshow**: An interactive slideshow showcasing images of Albert Einstein.
- **Interactive Timeline**: A feature that lets users explore key events in Einstein's life.
- **Quiz**: A fun, educational quiz on Albert Einsteinâ€™s life and work.

## Technologies Used
- **HTML**: To structure the content of the website.
- **CSS**: For styling and layout, ensuring a visually appealing and accessible design.
- **JavaScript**: To add interactivity, handle events, and integrate third-party APIs.
- **jQuery**: Used to simplify DOM manipulation and implement features such as the image zoom and scroll-to-top button.
